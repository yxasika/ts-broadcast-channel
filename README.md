# DISCLAIMER: WORK IN PROGRESS!
If you somehow stumble across this repo, the decorator is currently not working but will be in the next few days. This repo is just a braindump for how i would want to work with eventbased APIs (in this case the BroadcastChannel-API).

This approach follows a Guava-Eventbus-like annotation-based style. In addition to that the activation configuration allows developers to determine the `postMessage`-order in an aspect-programming style, with the `broadcastOrder` flag and its `*-before` and `*-after` lifecycles.

# BroadcastChannel Decorator ⚡️

### Description
The Broadcast-Decorator enables developers to build service-classes that share information between
browser-contexts in a clean way.

This package is 100% dep-free and easy to use!
